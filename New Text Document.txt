* Title Slide

  * Include the name of the Project and Group Members

* Motivation & Summary Slide

  * Define the core message or hypothesis of your project.
  * Describe the questions you asked, and _why_ you asked them
  * Describe whether you were able to answer these questions to your satisfaction, and briefly summarize your findings

* Questions & Data

  * Elaborate on the questions you asked, describing what kinds of data you needed to answer them, and where you found it

- Yu-Han Chen  7:07 PM
Amy: How wildfire affect air quality? 

- Jason Lei  7:09 PM
One question can be "Has the economical damage of wildfire increased in recent years?"

- Josh Gallagher  7:10 PM
Is there a correlation between cause of fire and size / destruction of fire?

- Josh Gallagher  7:34 PM
is there a difference between average temp/humidity/wind on any day for a location, and the avg temp/humidity/wind in the location of a fire
find out the trend of temp/humidity/wind 30/15/7/current by using scatter plot or line chart

- susan xia  7:56 PM
questions - what incidents cause the wildfire? and the cost related
and also we can find the 3 causes that cost the most money, and 3 cause that cause the most number of fires

- Josh Gallagher
using gmap API to find out the fire that is within a certain distance around big cities

* Data Cleanup & Exploration

  * Describe the exploration and cleanup process
  * Discuss insights you had while exploring the data that you didn't anticipate
  * Discuss any problems that arose after exploring the data, and how you resolved them
  * Present and discuss interesting figures developed during exploration, ideally with the help of Jupyter Notebook

* Data Analysis

  * Discuss the steps you took to analyze the data and answer each question you asked in your proposal
  * Present and discuss interesting figures developed during analysis, ideally with the help of Jupyter Notebook

* Discussion

  * Discuss your findings. Did you find what you expected to find? If not, why not? What inferences or general conclusions can you draw from your analysis?

* Post Mortem

  * Discuss any difficulties that arose, and how you dealt with them
  * Discuss any additional questions that came up, but which you didn't have time to answer: What would you research next, if you had two more weeks?

* Questions
  * Open-floor Q&A with the audience


Work Break-down:

Josh - weather factors that cause the wildfire: cleanup dataset, doing scatter/line chat to find out trend

susan - API; statistics analysis for weather factor and find out trend

Thaddeus - factors related to human activities or facilities, cause analysis. find out 3 reasons cause the most fires

Jason - factors related to human activities or facilities, cost analysis. find out 3 causes cost the most money

Amy - Effect - how air quality change after the wildfire
